// Abbreviate a Two Word Name

// Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

// The output should be two capital letters with a dot seperating them.

// It should look like this:

// Patrick Feeney => P.F

// samjam48

// Love vs friendship

// Ifã€€a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26

// Then l + o + v + e = 54

// and f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108

// So friendship is twice stronger than love :-)

// The input will always be in lowercase and never be empty.

// J or nor J
